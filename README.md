# Chaos
An exercise in plotting fractal equations. Displays either Sierpinski Triangle, Sierpinski Carpet, Henon Attractor or Julia Set plotted by a random algorithm. A new pattern is chosen on the hour. Pebble Time version adds a cool color shifting algorithm.

2.0 - Better positioning algorithm for Julia and Mandlebrot. Program checks to ensure position doesn't end up mostly blank or interior of Mandelbrot "lake". Improved visibility of Julia and Mandelbrot on B&W Pebbles.
